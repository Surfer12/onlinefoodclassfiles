I've created a comprehensive CSV file (system_features.csv) that tracks the system's features and their implementation status. The file includes:
Column Headers:
Feature Name - The name of the feature/method
Category - The system component it belongs to
Implementation Status - Current state (Implemented/Partially Implemented/Not Implemented)
Priority - Importance level (High/Medium/Low)
Description - Brief explanation of the feature
Current Limitations - Known issues or constraints
Planned Improvements - Future enhancements
The data includes 12 rows (not counting the header) covering various aspects of the system, based on both the current implementation and planned features from our documentation. Each feature is categorized and includes its current status and planned improvements.
The implementation statuses are:
Implemented: 5 features
Partially Implemented: 3 features
Not Implemented: 4 features
Would you like me to add any additional features or modify any of the existing entries?
