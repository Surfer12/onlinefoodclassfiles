Corresponding Required Updates
Referencing the src/main/java/app/docs/neededupdatesforcli documentation, several updates are necessary to address the test failures:  Initialize Menu on Entry
Ensure the main application initializes the menu upon starting without requiring additional input (issue: "initial run of main needs enter to initialize menu").
Handle Empty or Null Inputs
Implement input validation to handle empty strings or null values gracefully, preventing the application from crashing or behaving unexpectedly (issues: "space or null does not list as error entered", "Should handle empty/null inputs").
Manage Item Quantities in Orders
Allow the addition of the same item multiple times by updating the quantity instead of preventing duplicate entries (issue: "If we add two of same item after quantity is entered then it may not be added?").
Alteration of Orders
Implement functionalities to alter orders, such as adding items, changing quantities, or deleting items (issues: "alter order, add item, change item quantity, delete item").
Driver Management
Provide options to add or delete drivers dynamically instead of relying on a hardcoded list (issues: "add driver, delete driver", "remove hardcode of 5 drivers").
Assign drivers based on availability and workload (issue: "driver add to first not last of hardcoded list", "give driver id").
Rating Management Implement features to add or delete ratings (issues: "add rating, delete rating").
Allow managers to update driver ratings based on performance (issue: "manager driver gives info, but not update rating").
Validate rating values (issue: "Should validate rating values").
Order Processing
Ensure orders are processed correctly and assigned to the least busy driver (issue: "process orders didn't grab", "Should assign orders to least busy driver").
Handle scenarios where no available drivers exist or orders can't be processed (test: "Should handle failed order processing").
User Interface Enhancements
Improve the CLI navigation by differentiating menu options (issue: "4 and 7 are too similar"), possibly by renaming options or reordering them.
Implement clear exit messages and ensure users can exit from various menus smoothly (issues: "exit from enter driver manage drivers option 7", "exit from main menu message").
License Plate Generation
Implement random license plate generation with a configurable number of digits or characters (issue: "add license plate random and amount of numbers in it").
Logging and Error Messages
Provide meaningful exit messages and improve overall feedback to users (issue: "exit from main menu message").
Recommended Steps to Fix the Test Failures
Implement Input Validation
Modify the CLI to handle empty or null inputs without throwing exceptions.
Update validation logic in methods handling user input.
Update Order Management Functionality
Enable altering orders, such as adding/removing items and changing quantities.
Ensure duplicate items update existing entries instead of preventing addition.
Enhance Driver Management
Implement functionalities to add and delete drivers dynamically.
Assign drivers based on the least busy criteria.
Improve Rating System
Allow drivers to be rated using their driver IDs.
Implement the ability for managers to update driver ratings.
Ensure validation of rating values.
Refine License Plate Generation
Implement a method to generate random license plates with a specified number of digits or characters.
Improve CLI Navigation and User Experience
Adjust menu options to avoid confusion between similar numbered options.
Implement clear exit messages and ensure smooth transitions between different CLI menus.
Review and Update Test Cases
After implementing the required updates, ensure that the test cases are aligned with the updated functionalities.
Run tests iteratively during development to catch and fix issues early.
Example Code Adjustments
Below are examples of adjustments you can make to address some of the issues:
Handling Empty/Null Inputs
File: src/main/java/app/DeliverySystemCLI.java
}
Adding Drivers Dynamically
File: src/main/java/app/DeliverySystem.java
}
Assigning Orders to Best Available Driver
File: src/main/java/app/OrderProcessor.java
}
Updating Test Cases
Ensure your test cases accurately reflect the implemented functionalities. For example, to test handling empty inputs:
File: src/test/java/app/DeliverySystemCLITest.java
}
Addressing Specific Test Failures
Should handle empty/null inputs
Issue: The CLI crashes or behaves unexpectedly when empty or null inputs are provided.
Solution: Implement input validation as shown above to gracefully handle such inputs.
Should assign orders to least busy driver
Issue: Orders are not being assigned correctly based on driver availability and workload.
Solution: Implement the assignOrder method in OrderProcessor to select the least busy available driver.
Should handle failed order processing
Issue: The application does not handle scenarios where order processing fails due to no available drivers.
Solution: Update the assignOrder method to handle cases where no drivers are available and provide appropriate feedback to the user.
Should show rating statistics
Issue: The system fails to display correct rating statistics for drivers.
Solution: Implement functionality to calculate and display rating statistics based on driver ratings.
Should validate rating values
Issue: The system accepts invalid rating values, leading to inconsistent data.
Solution: Implement validation to ensure that rating values fall within acceptable ranges (e.g., 1-5 stars).
Should generate valid license plates
Issue: License plates are either hardcoded or not adhering to the required format.
Solution: Implement the generateRandomLicensePlate method to create random and valid license plates as shown above.
Should handle newline characters in input
Issue: The CLI does not handle newline characters in user input, leading to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Implement input validation to handle newline characters in the processInput and handleMenuChoice methods.
Should handle pressing Enter to continue through the process
Issue: The CLI does not handle pressing Enter to continue through the process, leading to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Implement input validation to handle pressing Enter to continue through the process in the start method.
Final Steps
Implement the Required Updates: Start by addressing each of the issues listed above, implementing the necessary code changes.
Run Tests Iteratively: After making changes, run your test suite to ensure that each test passes before moving on to the next.
Refactor and Optimize: Once all tests pass, refactor your code for better readability and maintainability.
Update Documentation: Reflect the changes in your README.md and other documentation to keep everything up-to-date.
Review and Merge: After thorough testing and documentation updates, review the changes and merge them into your main codebase.
Conclusion
By systematically addressing each failing test and implementing the corresponding updates, you can enhance the robustness and functionality of your Online Food Delivery System. Ensure to follow best practices in coding, testing, and documentation to maintain a high-quality codebase.
